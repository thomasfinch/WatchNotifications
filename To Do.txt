New Features
	Group notifications from the same app into the same banner
	Icon size option (small, normal, large)

Fixes
	App icon shadow with circular icons
	Better height calculation (based on text size, num lines, etc.)
	Copic compatibility
	Coono compatibility?
	FullNC compatibility?

To do for 2.0
	Test message title support
	Test message subtitle support
	Test message attachment support
	Fix cell height calculation


Ideas/Notes
	Make titleview + content view take up entire notification cell frame, and use a table view inset to make the top of the app icon visible (would simplify code)
	If lone cell, set title etc as it is now, if it's top then set app name as title and put titles in bold inside content view with time label aligned with it
	Hook UITableViewDelegate height for row to set row heights
